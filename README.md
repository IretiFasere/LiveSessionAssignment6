# LiveSessionAssignment6
This repository is for Live Session Assignment 6 for SMU Class MSDS 6306-402, Doing Data Science.
In this repository, we analyze the data set rollingsales_brooklyncleaned.csv.

## Below are the four things we accomplish with this analysis:

## 1. Create and Place a README file for this repository.   The README file in the 
##    project root directory that includes an explanation of the purpose of the project 
##    and the other files

## 2. Load up a data file contining files that clean up the data set.  A data directory 
##    containing files to load in and clean up the data. The clean up should include finding out
##    where there are outliers or missing values, deciding how you will treat them, making 
##    sure values you think are numerical are being treated as such (correct R class), etc.   
##    The name of the corrected data sets used are below:
##       • SquarefootageVsSalesPrice
##       • rollingsales_brooklyncleaned.csv

## 3.  An analysis directory containing a file (or files) for exploratory data analysis on 
##     the clean data to visualize the relationship between square footage and sales price.
##       • Repository name for file is jjhosker/LiveSessoinAssignment6/analysis.
##       • Html graph and writeup of square footage vs. sales price.

## 4.  A Paper directory containing a file (plain text or Markdown) that explains any 
##     meaningful patterns in this dataset.
##       • Repository name for file is jjhosker/LiveSessoinAssignment6/paper.
##       • Html files that explains patterns in dataset

## 5. Deliverable: A link to a repository (test-repo is fine) on GitHub containing the above. 
##    Need only one link per group. The repostiory should be able to be shared with others
